about: Draggable elements are a common UX pattern, specially on touch screens. But as a developer, you might know how challenging it is to apply it with JavaScript. Vue.js doesnâ€™t help in this case, either. So to simplify things, v-drag was written. Its purpose is to quickly integrate and customize draggable objects on projects using Vue.js.
